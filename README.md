3.  Python Basics and Data Structure - Pluralsight - Lab - 30/12/24

    - Building a digital cookbook app
    - Data Types
    - Designing the Recipe Data Structure (name, ingredients, instructions)
    - Putting it all together

                 ## Listing recipes
                          - for loops: listing the entire recipe book recipe by recipe
                 ## Query recipes(searching for recipe by name)
                          - upon execution, the user will be promped to enter a recipe name. The goal is to filter the existing recipes and retrieve those that match the user-provided name, populating the results into the found_recipes variable
                 ## Searching by ingredients

4.  Python Standard Library - Pluralsight - Lab - 30/12/24

    - Understand data serialization and its importance
    - Explore the Pickle module in Python for data serialisation
    - Implement and handle errors during pickling and unpickling
    - Enhance a recipe book application for data persistence between sessions

                 ## Data Serialization
                        -  The process of converting in - memory objects into a format that can be saved to disk or transmitted over a network, and later reconstructed.
                 ## Pickle Module
                        - A Python module that provides functionalities for serializing and deserializing Python objects
                 ## Implementing Load and Save Functions
                        - Created functions to handle the loading and saving of data to ensure the persistence of application state.
                 ## Pickling without a File
                        - How to serialize and deserialize data to and from bytes objects, which is useful in scenarios such as network transmission or database storage
                 ## Modifying the Main Function
                        - Incorporrated loading and saving recipes in the main function to ensure data persistence across different runs of the application

5.  Build a Library System with Python - Pluralsight - Lab - 30/12/24

    - In this hands-on project, we will construct an object-oriented "library system" with Python
    - We design 3 core classes: Book, Borrower and Library to stimulate fundamental librery operations, such as adding books, schecking out, and returning items.
    - Interactions between objects: as we developed these classes, we had also implement methods that allow these objects to interact.

6.  Regex Foundations and Essentials - Pluralsight - Lab - 31/12/24

        - Understanding the foundations of Regex and how to implement it in the pythoon programming language
        - Regex is a short regular expressions and it's a means of creating a pattern that can be used to match a specific type fo data. Example: phone number. Using Regex we can take any piece of information with a distinct pattern and create code that can parse data and collect anything matching that pattern.
        - Exercises:
            - First_Scripts
            - Input_Validation
            - Log_Search
            - Filtered_Log_Data
            - Final_Project

                     ## Common Matching Pattern
                            - \d: This caharacter matches any digit [0-9]
                            - \w: Matches any word character [a-z or A-Z]
                            - \s: Any white space character
                     ## Common Quantitative Patterns
                            - '+': Matches one or more of a pattern. E.g \d+means one or more digits
                            - '?': Means zero or one of a pattern
                            - '*': Means zero or more of a pattern
                     ## Escape Characters
