    - Explore Python itself
    - Pros and cons of Python

                 ## Why Python?
                    - Simple to learn
                    - Simple to use
                    - Great Community
                    - Widely used
                    - High demand
                 ## What is Python?
                    - Syntax - white spce
                    - General -purpose
                    - Multi-paradigm
                    - Interpreted
                    - Garbage-collected

3.  Python Basics and Data Structure - Pluralsight - Lab - 30/12/24

    - Building a digital cookbook app
    - Data Types
    - Designing the Recipe Data Structure (name, ingredients, instructions)
    - Putting it all together

                 ## Listing recipes
                          - for loops: listing the entire recipe book recipe by recipe
                 ## Query recipes(searching for recipe by name)
                          - upon execution, the user will be promped to enter a recipe name. The goal is to filter the existing recipes and retrieve those that match the user-provided name, populating the results into the found_recipes variable
                 ## Searching by ingredients

4.  Python Standard Library - Pluralsight - Lab - 30/12/24

    - Understand data serialization and its importance
    - Explore the Pickle module in Python for data serialisation
    - Implement and handle errors during pickling and unpickling
    - Enhance a recipe book application for data persistence between sessions

                 ## Data Serialization
                        -  The process of converting in - memory objects into a format that can be saved to disk or transmitted over a network, and later reconstructed.
                 ## Pickle Module
                        - A Python module that provides functionalities for serializing and deserializing Python objects
                 ## Implementing Load and Save Functions
                        - Created functions to handle the loading and saving of data to ensure the persistence of application state.
                 ## Pickling without a File
                        - How to serialize and deserialize data to and from bytes objects, which is useful in scenarios such as network transmission or database storage
                 ## Modifying the Main Function
                        - Incorporrated loading and saving recipes in the main function to ensure data persistence across different runs of the application

5.  Build a Library System with Python - Pluralsight - Lab - 30/12/24

    - In this hands-on project, we will construct an object-orientd "library system" with Python
    - We design 3 core classes: Book, Borrower and Library to stimulate fundamental librery operations, such as adding books, schecking out, and returning items.

                 ## Data Serialization
                        -  The process of converting in - memory objects into a format that can be saved to disk or transmitted over a network,
